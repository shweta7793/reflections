How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

   It has made the things easier to compare the changes and debug them faster.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It will help me in keeping track of the changes I have done in my code,and will be easily accessible if I wish to use some previous version of code.I can simply compare n see the changes I have done.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

  Pros of git are we will have suitable and well arragnged log of all the commits,i.e,neither to short ,nor to big.

  In cons I would say that if i forgot to commit, my diiferent versions wont be saved automaticaly

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Git provides commit to all files so that we dont have to do manually for each and every file.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

   git log is used to see the log of commit history and git diff is used to see the differences between two files.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

   there is no fear of mistakes if we are using version control

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    To freely explore into my code
